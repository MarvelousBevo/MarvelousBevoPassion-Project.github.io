Emergence:
    The beginning of a new activity is always exciting. It was for me when I first touched the piano, but that quickly changed as I took a few lessons from "Vivaldi Academy". It made me think of exhasting hours of practice, lessons and scoldings. I didn't nearly understand much about life as I do now.
    The more I think about it, the more I wish that I tried harder. I wished I enjoyed it a little more back then. On the bright side, I met the teacher that stayed with me for the next 7 years, almost 8. His name was Mr. John, or John Amar.

Brute Force:
    Around the age of 9, Piano was like school; it was hard, long practice, every day. I didn't understand why my parents chose for me to play piano. I was young at the time, 30 minutes of practice felt like hours. I didn't understand the importance of practice. I didn't understand the importance of repetition.
Golden Hour:
    On my 12th birthday, the year of the tiger, I recived a very special gift from my uncle & dad. It is the "Akai MPK mini 3" midi controller. Basically a mini electric piano. It was my favorite and I used it every day for the next 3 months. 
    I was in the front seat riding to school with my dad and I suddenly had to ask, "Why do many parents choose for their kids to play instuments?" He said, "Well, playing an insturent is scientifically supposed to help you with math. That is why many asian parents make their kids play piano or violin."
